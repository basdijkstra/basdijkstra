I teach test automation to companies worldwide.

You can find an overview of my training offerings [here](https://www.ontestautomation.com/training), or contact me to discuss your specific test automation training requirements. I'm happy to have a chat and discuss options.

I'm hosting a couple of free and open source workshops on here, too:

* [API testing in Java with REST Assured](https://github.com/basdijkstra/rest-assured-workshop)
* [API testing in C# with RestSharp](https://github.com/basdijkstra/restsharp-workshop)
* [API testing in Python with requests](https://github.com/basdijkstra/requests-workshop)
* [API mocking in Java with WireMock](https://github.com/basdijkstra/wiremock-workshop)

Feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:bas@ontestautomation.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/basdijkstra/) if you would like to work with me.
